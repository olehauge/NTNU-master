# The Home PC solution
This exercise can be performed individually or in groups up to three members. The target is to
train the terms and the risk mechanism, and not to completely secure the installation.
We want, that 10 risks per study are dealt with.

The family Meier lives on the 2nd floor of a 3 story house with 6 apartments. Family Meier has 3 children,
Lilian (21) studies economics, Jan (18) is a high school student and a computer geek, and Dora (12) who
likes to play outside or on the computer, but preferably with colleagues. Mr. Meier has a responsible
position in the Norwegian Administration and has to work a lot. 1-2 times a week he makes minor,
sometimes major work in the evening on the PC. Mrs. Meier is working in commercial sector; she is
responsible for the accounting of a communication company. She also handles the financial affairs and
accounts of the family.

The network consists of a VDSL internet access (100 Mbit/s) with wireless, the parent’s laptop, 3
children laptops, 2 tablets and 5 smartphones.
The laptops are in the price range from NOK 5000-15000.
configurations:
1. Parent’s PC is used as a server (printer, files and media), fixed wiring Gigabit Ethernet
2. Smartphones of parents are connected to wireless, the children have faster connection with
LTE, bur for file exchange they connect in addition to the WLAN. Several Bluetooth devices
are connected to their Smartphones
3. Tablets are connected to WLAN
4. Children’s laptops are connected by wire, but can use also wireless LAN
5. Access point with WEP encryption
6. All computers are configured with Microsoft Operating system
Lately, the children take also advantage of LTE (G4 and G5), because they realized, that internet is
faster than the home speed. In spite of using these connectionss, the remained partly in the local net,
e.g. wired Ethernet cable.

The family uses: Skype for Voice over IP, Whatsapp, Twitter, LinekedIn, FB, online banking and web
browsing. Of course, they use secretly other social platforms.
The parents send and receive e-mails with their computer. The children use the computer to solve and
compare homework. To check their emails, they use their smartphones.
A big change was the Corona lock down starting late February 2020. The whole family has been
working form home and sharing the internet of the family: Please identify risk associated with this
lock down.

Uncle Ismir Özutöck, the brother-in-law of Mrs. Meier, helps the family to maintain the network and
give advices in case of computer problems. Sometimes, when he maintains the laptops over a remote
session, he downloads programs from his cloud account (drop box), to make work easier or installs
new computer games which he had downloaded from a torrent website.

The family is a nice, advanced family from the upper middle class with best reputation.
1. What could all go wrong? Make a small risk analysis.

Rating: Scope of uncovered risks and systematic approach.

2. Build an action plan.

Review: Choice of measures and systematic approach. Important, that you show everything form
threats and weaknesses, vulnerabilities, risks, up to how one measure could cover several risks and
risk could need several measures. Also identify residual risks.
- create risks graph (spider diagram, risk matrix) to show risks before mitigation and after mitigation.
- How to find all risks?
You should take 10 risks to train the terms and mechanics. Completeness is not scope of this exercise.

Create packages of measures for:
- small less than 4000 NOK
- medium less than 15’000 NOK and
- large budget more than 15’000 NOK
Or:
- as configuration point 1.
- File/Printer server extra
- Fileserver, print server, bakup and

# Assignment 3 - XACML implementation

Downloaded and ran ```sunxacml```. Had to set the ```CLASSPATH``` variable in the commandline while running the application in order to make it run correctly.
```
oleandrehauge@Abrick:sample$ java -cp /Users/oleandrehauge/Downloads/sunxacml-1.2/lib/sunxacml.jar:/Users/oleandrehauge/Downloads/sunxacml-1.2/lib/samples.jar src/SimplePDP.java request/sensitive.xml policy/*.xml
```

# Assignment 3 - XACML implementation

Downloaded and ran ```sunxacml``` with the provided test data. Had to set the ```CLASSPATH``` variable in the commandline while running the application in order to make it run correctly. It was ran from the ```sunxacml-1.2/sample``` directory.
```
java -cp ../lib/sunxacml.jar:../lib/samples.jar src/SimplePDP.java request/sensitive.xml policy/*.xml```

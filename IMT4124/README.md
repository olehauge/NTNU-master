# Cryptology
This repository covers my work conducted in the IMT4124 course.
- Term paper (A)

## Course content
- Introduction - classical cryptography (Shift/Caesar cipher, Vigenere, Beaufort, Enigma, Vernam), basic information theory and unicity distance, security of classical ciphers. 
- Symmetric ciphers 1 (stream ciphers) - randomness and pseudorandomness, one-time pad versus a keystream generator, period and linear complexity, pseudorandom sequence generators (congruence generators, linear and non-linear feedback shift registers, non-linear filters, non-linear combiners, non-uniform decimation of sequences, examples of stream cipher designs, statistical testing of pseudorandom sequences, cryptanalysis of stream ciphers (the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm, algebraic attacks/immunity, correlation attacks/immunity). 
- Symmetric ciphers 2 (block ciphers) - definition, permutations of sets of 2^N elements, confusion/diffusion, Feistel ciphers and Substitution-permutation networks, S-boxes and non-linearity (differentially k-uniform mappings), examples of Feistel and SPN designs, cryptanalysis of block ciphers (algebraic attacks, known plaintext attacks (differential and linear cryptanalysis)). 
- Asymmetric ciphers - definition, intractability and NP-completeness, the Diffie-Helman cryptosystem, the RSA system, primality testing (Legendre and Jacobi symbols, Solovay-Strassen, Miller-Rabin), provable primes and Pocklington Theorem, factorization (Pollard rho), discrete logarithm (the baby step/giant step algorithm, the ElGamal cryptosystem), elliptic curves. 
- Hash functions and digital signatures - definition of hash functions, basic security properties (one-wayness, second pre-image, collision), basic construction (Davies-Meyer, Merkle-Damgård, sponge construction), applications (integrity check, HMAC), examples of hash function designs, digital signature definition, digital signature with RSA, signing and hashing.

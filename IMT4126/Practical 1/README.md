# Practical 01 - Matlab
## 1 Scope of the Practical
The practical will provide basic skills for MatLab programming, which is essential to solve the programming tasks, which will be issued in the subsequent practicals.
## 2 Introduction to Matlab
- Data types: How to initialize and manipulate data types like numerical array (vectors and matrices).
- Arithmetic and Boolean operation: Illustration of available arithmetic and Boolean operations in matlab.
- Logical operators: Illustration of various logical and branching operations
- Exploring plot function: Illustration on various plot functions.
## 3 Image processing using Matlab
- Illustration of built-in functions To illustrate on how to use built-in functions for basic image processing. This included read image, filtering, edge detection, histogram, contrast enhancement.
- Illumination of demos: Exploring the demos in image processing toolbox, that included both face detection and tracking as well as image enhancement techniques.

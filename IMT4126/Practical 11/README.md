# Practical 11 - Gait Recognition
## 1 Scope of the Practical
This practical will make you familiar with Gait Recognition. We will interactively work on these practical
tasks in a tutorial style. However the full exercise sheet should be completed in order to prepare yourself
for the final exam.
## 2 We will go over the 4 first steps of ACM
You have received a set of data related to gait recognition and some matlab functions needed for the analysis. The data consists of two walks of 10 different persons.

Task 1: Run Step1_ReduceNoise. Check the files in the directory Walk. Open any of the files and
plot the data of this file. How many cycles do you detect visually?

Task 2: Run Step2_SplitWalkIntoCycles. Check the files in the directory Cycles. Check the data
from the same user as you used in task 1. Did the software detect the same number of cycles as you did?

Task 3: Run Step3_NormalizeCycles. Open the files in the directory NormCycles. Check the data
from the same user as you used in tasks 1 and 2. Do you still find the same number of cycles as you did
before? Plot all cycles in 1 figure.

Task 4: Run Step4_CreateAverage. Load at the file Averages.mat. Plot the corresponding average
cycle in the figure from task 3 with LineWidth 3.

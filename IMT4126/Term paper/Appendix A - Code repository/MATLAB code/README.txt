These MATLAB scripts are taken from the KD practical to ensure proper calculation of FMR, FNMR, and EER. I do not claim ownership of them as they were produced by the professors at NTNU. 

They have been modified for the purpose of this paper. 

The DistScaledManhattan.m and DistSquaredEuclidean.m script were created by me. 

The text files 1-12 contains the anonymized samples collected for the paper and makes for a dataset with 3240 features (27 samples x 10 features x 12 users).

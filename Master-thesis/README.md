# Mater Thesis NTNU - Influence/Interference Operations
This repository will contain the work conducted during the writing of the master thesis at NTNU. 

## Research Ideas
**A heatmap of Norway used to detect interference opeations:** It is porven (study of MIT) that fake news spreads up to 6 times faster than factual news. We might use this to see where and when fake news are spreading geographically. MIT are working on an AI for identifying missinformation networks. Perhaps this could be used as the backbone? 

**Identifying I2 operations:** A paper looking into what behavioral parameters can be collected from SOME to detect influence/interference operations. What data points are needed to understand a persons behaviors and how can they be used to change it (Cambridge Analytica used the Big Five). 

**Privacy Settings of Social Media Accounts:** How can privacy settings in social media be violated for big data gathering and analysis. 

**How to Conduct Effecitve I2 Operations:** What should a good management framework look like for effective I2 operations?

**The Downside to Big Data:** How big data can be abused for targeting. 

**Target Audience Methodology for SOME Marketing:** How SOME can be used to TA marketing. 

**Coordinated Inauthentic Behavior:** [EU Disinfo Labs](https://weverify.eu/blog/coordinated-inauthentic-behaviour-detection-tree/)

**Potential PhD -** [Foreign influence operations in the cyber age](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:0c7513fa-b71c-4c15-9bd3-3c49858972c3)

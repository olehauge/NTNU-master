# Mater Thesis NTNU - Influence/Interference Operations
This repository will contain the work conducted during the writing of the master thesis at NTNU. 

## Research Ideas
''A heatmap of Norway used to detect interference opeations:'' It is porven (study of MIT) that fake news spreads up to 6 times faster than factual news. We might use this to see where and when fake news are spreading geographically. MIT are working on an AI for identifying missinformation networks. Perhaps this could be used as the back bone? 

Identifying I2 operations: A paper looking into what behavioral parameters can be collected from SOME to detect influence/interference operations. What data points are needed to understand a persons behaviors and how can they be used to change it (Cambridge Analytica used the Big Five).
